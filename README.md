# Login Page Project 

Hi! My name is Pedro Serretti, i'm a Computer Science student.

I'm doing a mini project of a login page in Flutter/Dart to expand my knowledge using Firebase.

(Developed with changes and adaptions inspired with by [Mitch Koko's videos](https://youtube.com/@createdbykoko))

## How it works

Currently, this project contains:
- Login Page
- Register Page 
- Forgot your password Page 
- Main Page (under development)
- CRUD (not started)

It still has some bugs, but i'm working on updating it and making it as good as possible!
